## CHANGELOG

### v1.2.2

- Optimized the chat window to allow input of newline characters and copying multiple lines of text into the chat box.
- Changed the key to send chat messages to `Ctrl+Enter`.
- Modified the key to accept all predictions to `Alt+Q`.
- Other minor optimizations.


### v1.1.13

- Fixed an issue where enabling the `code auto-completion` feature without opening the chat window would cause Visual Studio to crash during keyboard input.
- Fixed an issue where the prediction text box would overlap during continuous input.
- Optimized the code completion algorithm, making the response faster.
- Redesigned the prediction text box to make the distinction between line numbers and text more apparent.
