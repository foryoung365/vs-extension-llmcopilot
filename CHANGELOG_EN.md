## CHANGELOG

### v1.1.13

- Fixed an issue where enabling the `code auto-completion` feature without opening the chat window would cause Visual Studio to crash during keyboard input.
- Fixed an issue where the prediction text box would overlap during continuous input.
- Optimized the code completion algorithm, making the response faster.
- Redesigned the prediction text box to make the distinction between line numbers and text more apparent.
